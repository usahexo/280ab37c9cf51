#  Casino Rama introduces blackjack game within Yugoslavia

In addition to roulette and poker, Casino Rama in Yugoslavia now offers blackjack games. This popular casino game is played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and the goal is to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on the player's first two cards (an "early" win), or by having a higher total value than the dealer without going over 21 ("late" win).

Blackjack can be played with any number of decks, but the most common variations involve between six and eight decks. In land-based casinos, blackjack is usually dealt from a shoe containing six or eight decks. Online casinos typically use one or more decks. The game is also commonly played with a single deck, especially when gambling online.

The player may draw additional cards to try to improve their hand. As in poker, the ace is worth 1 point, face cards are worth 10 points, and all other cards are numbered at their face value. After each card is drawn, the player must decide whether to "hit", "stand", "double down", or "split". Players must hit if they have 16 or less points total on their first two cards (including any Ace), stand if they have 17 points total or more on their first two cards, double down if they have 11 points total or more on their first two cards (and don't want to hit again), or split if they have two of the same rank (two 8s, for example). When splitting, players make two new hands and place one bet on each hand.

If both of the player's first two cards are an Ace and any other number (except a ten-value card), then the player can choose to take another card ("hit") instead of standing. This is called "taking insurance". If the dealer has an Ace showing as their up card, they will offer insurance to the players. Insurance protects the player's bet against losing half of it to the house in case the dealer has a blackjack (an Ace and a ten-value card). 

If you accept insurance when offered by the dealer, your wager will automatically be doubled; should he have a blackjack, you lose only your initial wager rather than doubling down and potentially losing even more had you opted not to buy insurance..Players can also surrender after their second card is drawn if they believe that holding onto their hand will lead to them losing eventually. surrendering halves your bet instead of losing it all should you go bust. 

A player who stands wins if his hand contains a higher number of points than the dealer's does without exceeding 21; if one goes over 21 points with any combination of cards (known as breaking ), he loses regardless of whose hand has more points. dealers must hit until they reach 16 , at which point they must stand . A push occurs when both dealer and player have identical hands; this happens relatively often when both players opt for conservative play by not taking any risks.. Blackjack pays 3:2 on basic strategy , so a winning $10 bet would give back $15 plus ($10 x 3/2) = $17.50 .
