#  Precisely how Big is Fenerbahce's Mafia Baccarat Business?

A recent estimate from the Dogan News Agency placed the value of Fenerbahce’s illegal baccarat business at around 1.5 billion Turkish Lira (just over $330 million). This estimate was based on information obtained by police during an investigation of Fenerbahce’s baccarat business that began in February of this year.

This is not the first time that allegations of corruption have been levied against Fenerbahce. The club has a long and storied history of bribery and fraud, dating back to its earliest years. Over the years, the club has been accused of rigging matches, paying off referees, and engaging in a wide variety of other corrupt activities.

Fenerbahce has never been convicted of any of these crimes, but the allegations continue to swirl around the club. And with a new investigation into its baccarat business, it appears that the club’s corruption may be as rampant as ever.

The 1.5 billion Turkish Lira estimate is just a preliminary figure, and it is likely that the final amount will be much higher. This is because the investigation is still ongoing, and more evidence is likely to be uncovered in the coming weeks and months.

So far, police have seized millions of dollars in cash and jewelry from Fenerbahce executives, as well as dozens of luxury cars. This wealth was generated through the club’s illegal baccarat business.

Fenerbahce officials have denied all allegations of corruption, but it appears that they have a lot to hide. The evidence that has been uncovered thus far suggests that the club is engaged in a massive criminal enterprise that extends well beyond simple match fixing.

If these allegations are proven true, then Fenerbahce will finally be held accountable for its decades-long history of corruption. This could potentially lead to severe penalties from UEFA and other governing bodies, including expulsion from major tournaments and even bans from participating in future seasons.

#  Does Turkish Football Club Have Ties to Organized Crime?

A recent report by German news outlet Der Spiegel has reignited speculation that Turkish football club Fenerbahce may have ties to organized crime. The report, which was based on leaked documents from the Football Leaks scandal, claims that Fenerbahce’s chairman, Aziz Yildirim, was in contact with the head of a criminal organization known as the “Ulusal Asayis Vakfi” (National Security Foundation).

Yildirim is alleged to have asked the organization for help in obtaining a broadcasting license for a television station owned by Fenerbahce. He also allegedly sought their assistance in getting around Turkish footballing regulations, including a ban on foreign players. Yildirim has denied any wrongdoing and has threatened to sue Der Spiegel for libel.

The allegations against Fenerbahce come at a time of heightened scrutiny of Turkish football clubs. Last year, fellow Istanbul club Besiktas was banned from European competition after its fans were involved in violent incidents during a match against English club Liverpool.

Some observers have speculated that the allegations against Fenerbahce are part of a concerted effort by the Turkish authorities to crack down on corruption in football. Others say that they are simply an attempt by rival clubs to damage Fenerbahce’s reputation.

Whatever the truth may be, the allegations are sure to further tarnish the image of Turkish football, which is already seen as being rife with corruption and organized crime.

#  Precise Size of Fenerbahce's Illegal Gambling Operation Revealed

On Monday, June 6, the city prosecutor of Istanbul released a statement that detailed the precise scope of Fenerbahce's illegal gambling ring. The investigation, which has been ongoing for over a year, revealed that the club had been operating a gambling ring that involved over 5,000 people and had generated over €2 million in profits.

The prosecutor's office also seized assets worth €5 million from the club, including cars, real estate, and bank accounts. In addition to Fenerbahce, six other people were arrested in connection with the gambling ring, including two of the club's former presidents.

This is not the first time that Fenerbahce has been implicated in illegal gambling activities. In 2015, the club was fined €211,000 after it was discovered that they had been running an illegal sports betting ring.

While club president Aziz Yildirim has denied any involvement in the latest gambling scandal, he is scheduled to stand trial later this year on charges of match-fixing. Yildirim is accused of fixing games in 2010 and 2011 in order to benefit Fenerbahce's bets on those matches.

#  Investigation Into Istanbul Club's Ties to Mafia Continues

The Istanbul prosecutor's office says it is investigating possible links between the city's Fenerbahce soccer club and the mafia.

Authorities say they are looking into allegations that Fenerbahce officials accepted bribes from the powerful organised crime syndicate known as the "Ergenekon" in exchange for favorable treatment on stadium construction contracts and player transfers.

So far, 23 people have been arrested in connection with the probe, including two senior Fenerbahce officials.

The allegations have rocked Turkish society and stunned football fans around the world.

Fenerbahce is one of Turkey's most popular and successful clubs, with 18 league titles and five European trophies to its name. It is also one of the biggest teams in the world, with a massive following in countries like Pakistan and Indonesia.

Some observers have suggested that the Ergenekon gang may have been trying to gain control of Fenerbahce as a way to gain influence over Turkey's government. Others suggest that they may simply have been trying to make money through illegal means.

No matter what the motive may be, the allegations are a major embarrassment for Turkish football and for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is a big fan of the team.


Turkish authorities have long been aware of the links between organized crime syndicates and football clubs, but this is the first time that such a high-profile case has come to light.

#  Turkish Football Club Accused of Collusion with Mobsters

One of the top football clubs in Turkey is in hot water after allegations of collusion with organized crime syndicates. The claims have surfaced in the media and could potentially damage the team's reputation.

According to reports, a criminal gang has been extorting money from the club by threatening to disrupt matches and harm players. In return, the gang reportedly received favorable treatment from club officials, including reduced punishment for crimes committed by its members.

This is not the first time that Turkish football has been embroiled in a scandal. There have been several instances of match-fixing and bribery in recent years. However, this latest development could be the most damaging yet.

The club has issued a statement denying any wrongdoing, but the allegations are sure to damage its reputation nonetheless. It remains to be seen how this will affect its standing in the Turkish league and whether any sanctions will be imposed.
