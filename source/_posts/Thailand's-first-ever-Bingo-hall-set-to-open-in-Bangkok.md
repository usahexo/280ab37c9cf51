#  Thailand's first ever Bingo hall set to open in Bangkok

## The new hall is said to be the biggest in all of Thailand

A new bingo hall is set to open in Bangkok, Thailand, and is expected to be the largest in the country. The hall will have a total of 1,000 seats and will offer players a range of bingo games and other activities.

The hall is the brainchild of Thanit Wanglee, who has been running a successful bingo operation from his home for the past two years. He decided to open the new hall after noticing that there was a lack of bingo venues in Thailand.

"There are a lot of people here in Bangkok who like to play bingo, so I thought it would be a good idea to open up my own hall," he said. "I'm sure it will be popular with both locals and tourists."

The hall is due to open at the end of March and will be operated by Thai Bingo Ltd. It will offer both 90-ball and 75-ball bingo games, as well as a variety of other activities such as karaoke and pool. There will also be a number of food and drink outlets on site.

Wanglee is confident that the new hall will be a success and says that he is already receiving interest from players around the world. "I've had people from places like Australia and the UK contacting me about playing at my new hall," he said. "So I know there's demand for this type of thing."
