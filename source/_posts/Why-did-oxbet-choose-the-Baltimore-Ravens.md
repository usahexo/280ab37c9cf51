#  Are there any other reasons why Nietzsche might have been critical of Kant?

It is odd that Nietzsche should be so critical of Kant since the two have many similar philosophical positions. However, there may be a couple of reasons for this. The first reason may be that Nietzsche was bothered by Kant’s view of reason. For Kant, pure reason was the highest faculty in humans and it could be used to understand the world in an apriori manner. However, Nietzsche felt that this view was too optimistic and did not take into account the role of emotions and desires in human cognition. Additionally, Nietzsche may have been bothered by Kant’s view of ethics. For Kant, ethics were based on a priori principles such as the Categorical Imperative. However, Nietzsche felt that ethics should be based on the outcomes that they produce, rather than on abstract principles.
