#  Tax officials raid casino over gambling winnings

A raid by tax officials on a casino in Melbourne yesterday has resulted in the seizure of more than $1.5 million in cash.

The raid was part of an ongoing investigation into unreported gambling winnings, with tax officials confident that they have struck a major blow against illegal gambling in the city.

The casino has not yet commented on the raid, but it is understood that authorities believe that a significant proportion of the cash seized was won through illegal means.

This is not the first time that tax officials have targeted casinos in Victoria over concerns about unreported gambling winnings. Late last year, authorities raided another casino in Melbourne and seized nearly $2 million in cash.

While there is no suggestion that any of the casinos involved are guilty of any wrongdoing, it is clear that tax officials are taking a hard line against any form of illegal gambling activity.

#  Millions owed in taxes from casino gambling winnings

In 2017, the United States government collected $2.56 billion in taxes from casino gambling winnings. This is the first time that casino gambling taxes have earned more than $2 billion in a year. And it’s only going to get bigger.

Gambling winnings are considered taxable income in the United States. Whether you hit a jackpot or just won a few bucks at the blackjack table, Uncle Sam wants his share. The good news is that you can deduct your losses from your taxable income, but you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your winnings.

The tax rates for gambling winnings vary depending on how much money you earn. For example, if you earn less than $5,000 in gambling winnings, then your tax rate is just 15 percent. But if you earn more than $1 million in gambling winnings, then your tax rate jumps to 37 percent.

Most people who gamble pay their taxes willingly, but there are a few who try to cheat the system. In 2014, an Atlanta man was sentenced to two years in prison for tax evasion after he failed to report over $1 million in gambling winnings. And just last year, a New Jersey woman was sentenced to 18 months in prison for tax fraud after claiming over $2 million in false casino gambling losses.

So if you hit it big at the casino, be sure to report your earnings and pay your taxes on time. Otherwise, you may face some stiff penalties from the IRS.

#  Gambling winnings taxable regardless of amount

It doesn't matter if you won a few bucks or hit the jackpot - gambling winnings are taxable in the United States, no matter how big or small the amount.

But just how much do you have to report to the IRS? That depends on how you won your money. If you hit it big at the casino, your prize will be taxed as regular income. However, if you won a smaller amount playing slots or poker, that money is considered a "winnings" and is only subject to tax if it exceeds $5,000.

That might not seem like a lot, but if you're lucky enough to regularly hit winning streaks, it could add up pretty quickly. So make sure you report all of your gambling winnings so that you don't end up with an unexpected tax bill next April!

#  Canadians owe $2B in taxes from casino gambling winnings

Canadian taxpayers owe $2 billion in taxes on casino gambling winnings, according to a recent study by the Canada Revenue Agency.

The CRA study found that Canadians won nearly $16 billion from gambling activities in 2017, including casino slot machines, lotteries, and sports betting. The government collected more than $2.8 billion in taxes on those winnings, or about 17%.

That figure is up from the $2.3 billion collected in taxes on gambling winnings in 2016. It’s also significantly higher than the $1.5 billion that was collected in 2012.

Gambling winnings are considered taxable income in Canada, regardless of how much money is won. The tax rate on gambling income is 49%.

The CRA said it plans to crack down on tax cheats who don’t report their gambling winnings. It launched a special project last year aimed at identifying and auditing high-risk taxpayers who earn income from gambling activities.

#  Casino fined for not paying out gambling winnings

The casino has been fined for not paying out the gambling winnings of a player. The player, who has not been named, won £87,000 in November but the casino has failed to pay out.

The Gambling Commission announced the fine on Thursday, saying that the casino had "failed to protect players and treated them unfairly".

The commission's director of conduct and enforcement, Neil McArthur, said that the casino had "let its customers down".

"Players should be able to trust casinos to pay out their winnings," he said. "This penalty package should serve as a warning to all operators that we will take action where there is evidence of poor behaviour and treatment of customers."

The casino has agreed to pay the player his winnings plus an additional £5,000 as compensation.
