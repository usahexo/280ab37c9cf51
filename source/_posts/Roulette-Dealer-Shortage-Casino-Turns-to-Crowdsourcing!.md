#  Roulette Dealer Shortage? Casino Turns to Crowdsourcing!

The world of casinos is changing. With the rise of online gambling, traditional brick-and-mortar casinos are seeing a decline in revenue. In order to stay competitive, many casinos are turning to unique methods to bring in new customers.

One such casino is the Resorts World Casino in Queens, New York. Recently, they announced that they will be hiring roulette dealers through a crowdsourcing campaign on the website CrowdFlower.

Crowdsourcing is a method of outsourcing tasks to a large group of people (the "crowd"), typically through an online platform. In this case, casino officials will be crowdsource the hiring of roulette dealers by posting a job description and asking interested candidates to complete a task related to the job.

This is not the first time that Resorts World has used crowdsourcing to fill jobs. They have also used it to hire security guards, cocktail waitresses, and valets.

So why is Resorts World using crowdsourcing to hire roulette dealers? One reason may be because of the current shortage of qualified dealers. Casino officials say that they have had difficulty finding dealers who meet their high standards.

Another reason may be the cost savings associated with using crowdsourcing. Hiring through CrowdFlower is cheaper than hiring through traditional methods such as recruiting agencies or job boards.

Regardless of the reasons, it will be interesting to see how this crowdsourced dealer campaign plays out. Will Resorts World find qualified dealers through this method? Or will the campaign fall short and end up costing more than it saves? Only time will tell!
