#  Casino In Maine To Close Doors After 45 Years of Operation

The casino in Maine, which has been in operation for 45 years, will close its doors at the end of January. The casino's closure is a result of declining revenues and competition from newer casinos in other states.

The casino, which is owned by the Passamaquoddy Tribe, has about 100 employees. Those employees will be given the opportunity to transfer to other tribal businesses, or they will be offered severance pay and assistance in finding other employment.

In a statement, tribal officials said that the decision to close the casino was difficult but necessary. They thanked the employees for their years of dedication and service.

The closure of the casino will have a significant impact on the local economy. The tribe has pledged to do everything possible to help those affected by the closure.

#  Casino in Maine to Reopen Under New Management

The casino in Fort Kent, Maine is set to reopen under new management. The casino, which closed in February of 2018, is set to reopen on June 1, 2018 with a new name, the Northern Maine Casino Resort.

The casino will be operated by the St. John Band of Chippewa Indians, who own and operate the nearby St. John's Casino in Presque Isle, Maine. The tribe has plans to invest $10 million in the casino resort, including renovations to the property and new gaming and entertainment options.

The tribe also promises to create 150 jobs at the casino resort. "We are excited to reopen the Fort Kent casino and bring new jobs and economic development to the region," said tribal chairman Scott Peters.

The tribe has been seeking a license to operate a casino in Maine since 2004, but has been met with resistance from the state government. In 2012, the state government blocked the tribe from opening a second casino in Oxford County.

Despite the legal challenges, the tribe pressed on and finally secured a license for operation of the Fort Kent casino in 2017. "After 14 years of hard work we are finally able to bring our dream of a gaming resort to Fort Kent," said Peters.

#  Casino in Maine to Remain Open after State's Continued Financial Downturn

The Hollywood Casino in Bangor, ME has announced that it will continue to operate despite the financial downturn in the state. This is welcome news for the more than 800 employees at the casino, as well as for the city of Bangor, which relies on the casino for significant tax revenue.

The Bangor City Council had been discussing the possibility of closing the casino in order to help address the city's budget shortfall. However, with the announcement from Hollywood Casino that it will stay open, the council has decided to postpone any decision on the casino's future until later this year.

This is good news not just for Bangor but also for Maine's economy as a whole. The Hollywood Casino is one of only two casinos in Maine, and it generates millions of dollars in revenue each year.Closure of the casino would have had a devastating impact on both Bangor and Maine's economy.

It remains to be seen how long the Hollywood Casino will be able to remain open in light of Maine's ongoing financial difficulties. However, for now at least, it looks like Bangor's casino will be staying open.
