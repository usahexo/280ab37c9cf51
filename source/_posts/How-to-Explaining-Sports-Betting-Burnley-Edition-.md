#  How to Explaining Sports Betting: Burnley Edition 

Burnley is one of the most interesting teams to watch in the English Premier League this season. The Clarets have been one of the most surprising sides in the league, as they sit in 7th place with 20 points after 13 games. Sean Dyche’s side has been able to achieve this despite being one of the smaller clubs in the division. 

The reason for Burnley’s success has been their strong defense. The Clarets have conceded only 14 goals in 13 games, which is the 2nd best record in the Premier League. This has been due to their excellent back line, as well as their goalkeeper Tom Heaton, who has been one of the top performers in the league this season. 

Offensively, Burnley has not been as impressive, scoring only 14 goals so far. However, they have been able to score some crucial goals, such as Ashley Barnes’ winner against Brighton last month. This goal gave Burnley their first ever win at Brighton’s Amex Stadium. 

So far this season, there have been a number of interesting betting storylines involving Burnley. One of these is whether or not the Clarets can maintain their current position and qualify for Europe next season. Another is whether or not Barnes can continue his good form and score more goals. 

There are a number of bookmakers offering odds on these types of bets. One bookmaker that is currently offering good odds on Burnley qualifying for Europe is Pinnacle Sports . They are currently offering odds of 2/1 on Burnley making it into European competition next season. As for Barnes, Paddy Power offers odds of 9/2 on him being the Premier League’s top scorer at the end of the season

Burnley Football Club is a professional association football club based in Burnley, Lancashire. The team plays in the Premier League, the top tier of English football.

The origins of Burnley F.C. lie with the church football teams of the area, who played games on local public pitches and green spaces. The first recorded game of football being played in Burnley was in 1885 by Starkholmes Wesleyan Church; however, it was not until 1886 that Burnley Rovers were formally established. On November 3, 1887, Burnley Rovers joined the Lancashire League.

The Turf Moor stadium was first used as the home ground for Burnley F.C. in 1883. However, it was not until 1920 that the club purchased the stadium from Turf Moor Estate for £1,500 with the help of donations from supporters.

In 1888, Burnley entered into their first competitive match, which was a cup competition called the Lancashire Challenge Cup (now known as the FA Cup). They reached the quarter-final stage but lost to Blackburn Rovers. In 1892–93, they became one of founder members of Division Two of The Football League (now known as Football League Championship). However, they only lasted one season in this division and were relegated to Division Three North (now League One). In 1899–1900, they regained their place in Division Two and remained there until relegation once more at the end of 1907–08 season. 1912 saw their return to Division One after winning Division Two but they lasted just one season and were relegated again in 1913–14 season but this time they failed to win promotion back to Division One and spent six seasons in Division Two before relegation at the end of 1922–23 season which ended their first spell in England's top division. 

In 1924–25 season, they regained their place back in Division One but were relegated once more at the end of 1928–29 season despite finishing fourth from bottom. After three seasons in Division Two (the last two as runners-up), they returned to Division One as champions at the end of 1931–32 season but lasted just two seasons before relegation once again at the end of 1933–34 season which marked start of a downward spiral for club who spent next 16 years bouncing between divisions II & III with just one single season outside these leagues . 

The Clarets finally started to stabilise themselves during 1950s when they managed to spend nine consecutive seasons playing outside top 2 tiers which included a period where they played 4 consecutive seasons while competing in 3 different divisions (III North IV West & III South) before returning to top 2 tiers during 1958–59 season where they competed for next 8 consecutive seasons without any major success although did reach semi-finals during 1962 Anglo-Italian Cup).[5] It was not until 1967/68—under new manager Harry Potts—that things started to change for better as club finished 4th during 1967/68 campaign which also coincided with club's centenary year . This led to better days for both Potts & club as over next five years he led them to two promotions (one via FA Cup) which saw them return to top flight after relegation during 1971/72 season . Unfortunately for Potts his success with club didn't last long after he got sacked just 9 games into 1974/75 campaign following poor run of results that left them marooned at bottom half table . 
They were then managed by Joe Harper who couldn't prevent them from being relegated during 1975/76 campaign despite reaching semi-finals of League Cup which resulted in their departure from top flight after spending only 3 years there . After spending next 3 seasons outside top 2 tiers ,they made an immediate return back up as Second Division Champions during 1978/79 campaign under new manager Brian Miller.[6] 
After winning promotion back to First Division ,they finished 16th during 1979/80 campaign which continued their inconsistent performances over next four seasons where results ranged from finishing 11th 1981/82 & 1982/83) > 3rd position during 1983/84 but then suffered another relegation during 1984/85 campaign . They bounced straight back up as runners-up during 1985/86 campaign under new manager Jim Platt but got relegated again just one season later during 1986/87 campaign despite being mid-table most part of it due mainly poor form towards end part of season[7] 
This led Tommy Docherty taking charge midway through 1987/88 who couldn't save them from relegation duebottom place finish resultingin first ever time competingoutside England'stop 2 tiers since joining league structure 108 years ago.[8]Docherty then resigned leaving ex-player Steve Kindon appointed player-manager who couldn't prevent club from suffering immediate relegationduring his very first managerial job despite some impressive individual displays by some players such as Paul Jewell Neil Webb  etc.. It wasn't until Mike Mandaric took charge that

#  The Best Way to Win Money Betting on Burnley Soccer 

There are a lot of things that go into being a successful sports bettor, but one of the most important is to find value in your bets. This means finding odds that are significantly different from the true chances of a team winning or losing. 

When it comes to betting on Burnley soccer, there are plenty of opportunities to find value. This is due largely to the fact that they are not a very popular team, which means that the oddsmakers don't have as much information about them as they do about other teams. As a result, they often set the odds too high or too low relative to Burnley's true chances of winning or losing. 

Of course, finding good value bets is only part of the puzzle. You also need to make sure that you are well-informed about the teams and players involved in each game. This includes knowing about recent form, injuries, and other factors that could affect the outcome of the match. 

If you can find good value bets and also make smart predictions about the outcomes of games, then you can make a lot of money betting on Burnley soccer.

This makes them a strong favourites at home and it may be worth looking at odds of around 1/2 for a home win when betting on Burnley.

Their away form has not been as good, with just two wins and three defeats, but they can still be competitive against teams in the bottom half of the table. As a result, it is worth looking at odds of around 11/8 for an away win when betting on them.

For example, you could back them to win both halves or to lose by one goal as well as having a bet on who will score first. This can give you more options when it comes to cashing out if things don’t go your way early on in the game.
