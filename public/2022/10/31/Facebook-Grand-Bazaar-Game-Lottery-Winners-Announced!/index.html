<h1 id="10-000-Lottery-Prize-Still-up-For-Grabs-in-Facebook-Grand-Bazaar-Game"><a href="#10-000-Lottery-Prize-Still-up-For-Grabs-in-Facebook-Grand-Bazaar-Game" class="headerlink" title="$10,000 Lottery Prize Still up For Grabs in Facebook Grand Bazaar Game"></a>$10,000 Lottery Prize Still up For Grabs in Facebook Grand Bazaar Game</h1><p>A $10,000 lottery prize is still up for grabs in the Facebook Grand Bazaar game, according to a recent announcement by the game’s developers. The prize was initially announced as being awarded to the first player to accumulate 100,000 points in the game, but no one has yet been able to do so.</p>
<p>“We’re really excited to see how this contest plays out,” said one of the game’s developers in a recent interview. “It’s been a lot of fun watching people try to rack up those points.”</p>
<p>The Facebook Grand Bazaar is a digital marketplace where players can buy and sell virtual items using credits. The game is set up like a real-world bazaar, with different stalls representing different countries. Players can travel between stalls to buy and sell items, as well as earn bonus points for completing tasks such as purchasing multiple items from the same country or completing transactions within a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>Since the contest began last month, players have been frantically trying to rack up points in order to win the $10,000 prize. So far, no one has been able to accrue 100,000 points, but that may change soon.</p>
<p>“I’m getting close,” said one player who has already accumulated more than 75,000 points. “I think I can do it!”</p>
<p>Others aren’t so sure. “It’s going to be tough,” said another player who has only managed to score around 25,000 points so far. “But I’m going to keep trying.”</p>
<p>The developers of the game say that they will continue awarding the prize until someone finally manages to hit 100,000 points. So far, no one has come close. Will you be the first?</p>
