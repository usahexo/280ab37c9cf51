The event was sponsored by the local miner’s union, and offered a first place prize of $10,000.</p>
<p>The tournament began on Saturday morning with the first round of play, which reduced the field of competitors down to just sixty-four. Those players then moved on to the second round, which was played that evening. After several hours of intense play, only eight competitors remained.</p>
<p>The final table began on Sunday morning, with the first player eliminated just minutes after the start of play. It wasn’t long before another competitor fell, leaving just six players in the running for the top spot. In the end it was Daniel Shelton who emerged victorious, taking home the $10,000 prize as well as a seat in next year’s tournament.</p>
<p>When asked about his victory, Shelton said that he had been playing poker for most of his life and that he had always enjoyed tournaments more than cash games. He also credited his success to his lucky miner’s deck, which he said had helped him win several big pots during the final table.</p>
