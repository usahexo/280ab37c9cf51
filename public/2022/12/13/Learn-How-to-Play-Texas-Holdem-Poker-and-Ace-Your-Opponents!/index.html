It is a game of skill, strategy and chance. You can play it anywhere, anytime. In this article, we will teach you how to play Texas Holdem Poker and ace your opponents!</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is learn the basic poker hand rankings. The rank of hands from lowest to highest are: high card, pairs, two pair, three of a kind, straight, flush, four of a kind, full house, five of a kind, royal flush.</p>
<p>Poker hands are ranked according to the following criteria:<br>-One pair is higher than no pair.<br>-Two pair is higher than one pair.<br>-Three of a kind is higher than two pair.<br>-A straight is higher than three of a kind.<br>-A flush is higher than a straight.<br>-A full house is higher than a flush.<br>-Four of a kind is higher than a full house.<br>-A straight flush is higher than four of a kind.     -A royal flush is the highest hand and beats everything else.</p>
<p>Now that you know the basics, let’s move on to the rules of Texas Holdem Poker! The game is played with 52 cards and there are usually six players at the table. Before the cards are dealt, each player places an equal bet (called an Ante) in the pot. The dealer deals two cards face down to each player and two cards face up - these are called the flop. The player with the highest card(s) starts the action - they may either bet (called opening), check (not bet), raise or fold (lose their cards and end their turn). Play then proceeds clockwise around the table as each player either bets or folds as best suits them given the current situation. After all players have had their turn (and any raises have been contested), another card is dealt face up - this is called the turncard . Again, play proceeds clockwise around the table and each player has another opportunity to bet or fold depending on their hand and position at the table etcetera… Finally, after all players have had their turn again (and any raises have been contested), another card is dealt face up - this is calledthe rivercard . The player withthe best fivecard poker hand wins the pot! Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<p> 13 4 5 6 2</p>
<p> 1 3 5 7 9In this example, Player 1 has an Ace high hand with 3 other matching cards (pair + kicker). This would beat Player 2’s King high hand with 2 other matching cards (pair + kicker). If both players had exactlythe same rank for all fivecards , thenthe pot would be split equally between them).</p>

This guide will teach you everything you need to know in order to start playing this incredibly fun and popular card game.</p>
<p>First, we’ll take a look at the basic rules of Texas Holdem Poker. After that, we’ll discuss the different hands that can be made in the game, and how to calculate your odds of winning them. Finally, we’ll go over some basic strategy tips that will help you win more often when playing Texas Holdem Poker.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let’s get started!</p>
<p>The Basic Rules of Texas Holdem Poker</p>
<p>Texas Holdem Poker is a game that can be played with anywhere from 2 to 10 players. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, and the aim of the game is to create the best possible five-card poker hand using any two of your pocket cards and the five community cards on the table.</p>
<p>The player who bets first in each round is known as the “dealer.” The dealer position rotates clockwise around the table after each hand is completed. The player to the dealers left starts each hand with two “hole” cards, which are concealed from all other players. The remaining players are then dealt three face-up community cards, also known as the “flop.” A fourth community card (the “turn”) is then dealt face-up, followed by a fifth and final community card (the “river”), which is also dealt face-up.</p>
<p>After all of the community cards have been dealt, each player then completes their hand by combining their two hole cards with any five of the community cards. The best possible five-card poker hand takes precedence over all other hands, regardless of whether it was made using one’s own hole cards or not.</p>
<p>The betting process in Texas Holdem Poker is relatively simple. Each player must either call (match) the amount wagered by the previous player, raise (increase) the bet by a predetermined amount, or fold (quit) their hand and forfeit any potential winnings. The first player to act is always determined by rotating clockwise around the table starting with the dealer button. Players must act in turn unless they are all folding (in which case there is no action taken on that particular turn). Once all players have either called or folded, the next round of betting begins. If a player has folded they cannot reenter that particular pot unless there has been a new betting round since they folded (in which case they may rejoin at whatever amount that new betting round concludes at). </p>
<p>The showdown occurs when only two players remain in contention for the pot - usually this occurs when one player has either raised all others out of a pot or when everyone else has folded preflop). At this point, both players will show their hands to determine who wins the pot. If one player has shown a better hand than the other then they automatically win - otherwise it’s a tie and it’s returned to whoever had control of the pot at end of previous betting round (usually means it goes back to original raiser).  </p>
<p> That’s essentially all you need to know in order to start playing Texas Holdem Poker - so let’s move on to discussing some of the different hands that can be made in this game! </p>

<h2 id="The-Basics"><a href="#The-Basics" class="headerlink" title="The Basics"></a>The Basics</h2><p>Texas holdem poker is a five-card draw game.

<h1 id="Learn-the-Rules-of-Texas-Holdem-Poker-and-Be-a-Winner"><a href="#Learn-the-Rules-of-Texas-Holdem-Poker-and-Be-a-Winner" class="headerlink" title="Learn the Rules of Texas Holdem Poker and Be a Winner!"></a>Learn the Rules of Texas Holdem Poker and Be a Winner!</h1><p>Texas Holdem Poker is one of the most popular poker variants. The game is played with a deck of 52 cards and two to ten players can take part. The aim of the game is to make the best five-card hand using any combination of the seven cards available to them (two down, five community).</p>
<p>At the beginning of each hand, each player is dealt two cards face down called hole cards. After all players have seen their hole cards, a round of betting takes place starting with the player to the left of the big blind.</p>
<p>The next three cards are then turned over - these are called the flop. Another round of betting ensues, starting with the first active player to the left of the button.</p>
<p>If there has been no raise before the flop, then any player may check (not bet). If there has been a bet, only a player who raised can re-raise. The fourth community card is then turned over (called turn) and a final round of betting takes place.</p>
<p>The fifth and final community card is turned over (called river) and players remaining in the hand must show their cards to decide who wins. The highest value poker hand wins - this can be either five-of-a-kind, royal flush or four-of-a-kind etc. If there is a tie, then the pot is split equally between those players holding winning hands. </p>
<p>Now that you know how to play Texas Holdem Poker, it’s time for you to put this knowledge into practice! Here are some tips that will help you become a winner: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Play tight: One mistake that novice players often make is playing too many hands. Remember - patience is key in Texas Holdem Poker so try not to get caught up in all the action and instead focus on playing high quality hands only. This will increase your chances of winning in the long run. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn how to read your opponents: One important skill that you need to master if you want to win at Texas Holdem Poker is reading your opponents. By observing what they do both preflop and postflop, you’ll be able to get an idea of what type of hands they’re likely holding and make more informed decisions when it comes time to act. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Use position advantage: Another important factor that you need to consider when playing Texas Holdem Poker is position - i.e., who’s sitting in which seat at the table. In general, you want to be in as strong a position as possible so that you can more easily control the size of pots and limit your opponent’s options when it comes time for them to act.</p>
