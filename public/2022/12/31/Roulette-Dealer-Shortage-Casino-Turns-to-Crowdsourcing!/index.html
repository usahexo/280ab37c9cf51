Casino Turns to Crowdsourcing!"></a>Roulette Dealer Shortage? Casino Turns to Crowdsourcing!</h1><p>The world of casinos is changing. With the rise of online gambling, traditional brick-and-mortar casinos are seeing a decline in revenue. In order to stay competitive, many casinos are turning to unique methods to bring in new customers.</p>
<p>One such casino is the Resorts World Casino in Queens, New York. Recently, they announced that they will be hiring roulette dealers through a crowdsourcing campaign on the website CrowdFlower.</p>
<p>Crowdsourcing is a method of outsourcing tasks to a large group of people (the “crowd”), typically through an online platform. In this case, casino officials will be crowdsource the hiring of roulette dealers by posting a job description and asking interested candidates to complete a task related to the job.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Resorts World has used crowdsourcing to fill jobs. They have also used it to hire security guards, cocktail waitresses, and valets.</p>
<p>So why is Resorts World using crowdsourcing to hire roulette dealers? One reason may be because of the current shortage of qualified dealers. Casino officials say that they have had difficulty finding dealers who meet their high standards.</p>
<p>Another reason may be the cost savings associated with using crowdsourcing. Hiring through CrowdFlower is cheaper than hiring through traditional methods such as recruiting agencies or job boards.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reasons, it will be interesting to see how this crowdsourced dealer campaign plays out. Will Resorts World find qualified dealers through this method? Or will the campaign fall short and end up costing more than it saves? Only time will tell!</p>

<h1 id="ComeOn-Casino-Goes-Public-with-Dealer-Shortage-Issue"><a href="#ComeOn-Casino-Goes-Public-with-Dealer-Shortage-Issue" class="headerlink" title="ComeOn Casino Goes Public with Dealer Shortage Issue"></a>ComeOn Casino Goes Public with Dealer Shortage Issue</h1><p>Casino gaming has come a long way over the last several decades.

This type of gaming allows people from all over the world to enjoy casino games in the comfort of their own home.</p>
<p>While online casino gaming offers many advantages, one disadvantage is the potential for dealer shortages. For example, ComeOn Casino, a popular online casino company, recently went public with its dealer shortage issue. According to Reuters, due to increased popularity and regulatory changes in certain markets, ComeOn Casino is facing a shortage of qualified dealers. This shortage is limiting the company’s ability to grow in those markets.</p>
<p>The shortage of dealers is not limited to ComeOn Casino. Many other online casinos are also experiencing similar issues. This problem is likely to continue as online gambling grows in popularity. As a result, companies within the industry will need to find innovative ways to recruit and retain dealers.</p>
