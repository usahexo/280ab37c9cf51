            <h1 id="Mavericks-Lose-To-Atlanta-Fall-to-Unfavorable-Record"><a href="#Mavericks-Lose-To-Atlanta-Fall-to-Unfavorable-Record" class="headerlink" title="Mavericks Lose To Atlanta, Fall to Unfavorable Record"></a>Mavericks Lose To Atlanta, Fall to Unfavorable Record</h1><p>The Mavericks put up a good fight, but they were not able to overcome the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night. Dallas falls to an unfavorable record of 13-27 with the 115-107 loss.</p>
<p>Luka Doncic led the Mavericks in scoring with 27 points on 8-of-17 shooting. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 21 points and Dirk Nowitzki had 20 points off the bench. Dwight Powell chipped in 18 points and nine rebounds for Dallas.</p>
<p>The Hawks were led by Trae Young and John Collins who both scored 26 points apiece. Collins also hauled in 11 rebounds for a double-double. Taurean Prince scored 19 points, and Kent Bazemore tallied 15 points in the win.</p>
<p>Atlanta held a slim 58-57 lead at halftime, but opened up the game in the third quarter, outscoring Dallas 33-24 to take control of the game. The Mavericks made a late push in the fourth quarter, but it was not enough as they fall to their sixth straight loss.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Dallas will host Orlando on Thursday night before hitting the road for back-to-back games against Cleveland and Detroit over the weekend.</p>
<h1 id="Dallas-Mavericks-Fall-to-8-37-with-String-of-Unfavorable-Results"><a href="#Dallas-Mavericks-Fall-to-8-37-with-String-of-Unfavorable-Results" class="headerlink" title="Dallas Mavericks Fall to 8-37 with String of Unfavorable Results"></a>Dallas Mavericks Fall to 8-37 with String of Unfavorable Results</h1><p>It was another tough week for the Dallas Mavericks who are now 8-37 on the season after string of unfavorable results. The Mavericks started the week with a 103-98 loss to the Washington Wizards on Monday night. It was their fourth consecutive loss and eighth in their last nine games. Rookie Luka Doncic led the way for Dallas with 18 points and 10 assists, but no other player scored more than 13 points as the Mavericks struggled offensively.</p>
<p>They followed that up with a 111-99 loss to the Miami Heat on Wednesday night. Dwyane Wade led Miami with 22 points while Hassan Whiteside added 21 points and 20 rebounds. Rookie Deandre Ayton led Dallas with 19 points and 11 rebounds, but no other player scored more than 10 points as the Mavericks were once again unable to generate much offense.</p>
<p>The Mavericks then suffered their worst loss of the season on Friday night, getting blown out by the Oklahoma City Thunder 137-123. Russell Westbrook led all scorers with 27 points while Paul George added 25 points. Dirk Nowitzki led Dallas with 18 points, but no other player scored more than 12 as the Mavericks were simply overpowered by OKC.</p>
<p>And to cap off their disastrous week, the Mavericks lost 116-106 to the Detroit Pistons on Sunday night. Blake Griffin led Detroit with 26 points while Andre Drummond added 18 points and 20 rebounds. Luka Doncic led Dallas once again with 23 points and 10 assists, but no other player scored more than 14 as the Mavericks continued to struggle offensively.</p>
<p>Overall, it was an absolutely disastrous week for the Dallas Mavericks who are now just 2-17 in their last 19 games. They will look to get back on track when they host the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday night.</p>
<h1 id="Dallas-Mavericks-Continue-to-Struggle-With-Unfavorable-Results"><a href="#Dallas-Mavericks-Continue-to-Struggle-With-Unfavorable-Results" class="headerlink" title="Dallas Mavericks Continue to Struggle With Unfavorable Results"></a>Dallas Mavericks Continue to Struggle With Unfavorable Results</h1><p>After a successful preseason with rookie Luka Doncic in the lineup, things have not gone as planned for the Dallas Mavericks to start the regular season. In their first 10 games, they have only won 3 of them and sit in 14th place in the Western Conference.</p>
<p>While there are still plenty of games left to be played, the Mavs will need to turn things around quickly or else they will find themselves out of playoff contention before long. One of their biggest problems has been defense, as they are giving up 112 points per game which is 26th in the league.</p>
<p>There have been some positive signs though, such as Doncic’s impressive play so far. The 19-year-old from Slovenia is averaging 17 points, 5 rebounds, and 4 assists per game, and looks like he could be a superstar in the NBA for years to come.</p>
<p>Another bright spot for Dallas has been veteran center DeAndre Jordan. The 29-year-old is averaging a double-double with 14 points and 14 rebounds per game, and has been one of the few consistent players on the team.</p>
<p>Despite the struggles so far, there is still time for the Mavericks to make a run and reach the playoffs. They will need to improve on defense and get more contributions from their other players if they want to make it happen though.</p>
<h1 id="Mavericks-Stay-Alive-in-Postseason-Hunt-Despite-String-of-Unfavorable-Results"><a href="#Mavericks-Stay-Alive-in-Postseason-Hunt-Despite-String-of-Unfavorable-Results" class="headerlink" title="Mavericks Stay Alive in Postseason Hunt Despite String of Unfavorable Results"></a>Mavericks Stay Alive in Postseason Hunt Despite String of Unfavorable Results</h1><p>In a season full of ups and downs, the Dallas Mavericks have found themselves in an unfavorable position. With just 11 games left in the regular season, they are currently 2.5 games out of the last playoff spot in the Western Conference.</p>
<p>Many experts had written them off before the season even started, but they have proved time and time again that they are not ready to give up quite yet. A big reason for their recent success has been the play of Luka Doncic, who is averaging over 20 points and 10 rebounds per game over his last 10 contests.</p>
<p>If they want to make a run at the postseason, the Mavericks will need to continue to play consistent basketball and win some key matchups against teams ahead of them in the standings. Here are three of those matchups that could determine their fate:</p>
<p>3&#x2F;14 vs Timberwolves<br>3&#x2F;17 vs Trail Blazers<br>4&#x2F;4 vs Spurs</p>
<h1 id="Dallas-Mavericks-End-Season-on-Down-Note-With-Many-Unfavorable-Results"><a href="#Dallas-Mavericks-End-Season-on-Down-Note-With-Many-Unfavorable-Results" class="headerlink" title="Dallas Mavericks End Season on Down Note With Many Unfavorable Results"></a>Dallas Mavericks End Season on Down Note With Many Unfavorable Results</h1><p>The Dallas Mavericks (24-58) finished their sixteenth season on a down note. Many unfavorable situations and events occurred throughout the year, most notably the trade demands of All-Star forward Kristaps Porzingis.</p>
<p>The offseason started with high hopes as the Mavericks acquired DeAndre Jordan in free agency. The team then traded for Porzingis from the New York Knicks in February. The thought was that with Jordan and Porzingis, Dallas could make a playoff push. However, that was far from what happened.</p>
<p>Porzingis played in just 48 games due to injury and averaged less than 20 points per game. In fact, the most productive player on the team statistically was guard Luka Doncic, who won Rookie of the Year honors. Other than Doncic, no other Maverick averaged more than 10 points per game.</p>
<p>Due to this lack of production, the Mavericks were one of the worst teams in the league after the All-Star break. They went 11-27 and missed out on making the playoffs by a wide margin. This disappointing season led to head coach Rick Carlisle being fired and several players being traded or released.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a difficult year for Mavericks fans to watch. There were many ups and downs and very few positive moments. Hopefully, things will be better for them next season with a new coach and some new players.</p>
