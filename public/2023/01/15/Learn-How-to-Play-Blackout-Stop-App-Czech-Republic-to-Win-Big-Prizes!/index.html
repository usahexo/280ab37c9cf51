<p>Once you know the game, start by clearing the outside edges of the board. This will give you more space to work with and make it easier to match colors. Use the power-ups wisely – for example, use the bomb power-up to clear a large section of the board at once.</p>
<p>In general, try to match colors as quickly as possible. This will increase your score and help you win more easily. If you get stuck, don’t be afraid to use a hint – but remember that each hint costs coins, so use them sparingly!</p>
